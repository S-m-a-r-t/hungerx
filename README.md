# 🍽️ HungerX – Campus Food, Delivered Smartly

**Hungerx** is a web-based food ordering platform tailored specifically for college campuses. It connects students with on-campus canteens and food outlets, allowing them to place orders directly from their rooms and get notified once the food is ready.

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **Order Online**: Browse menus from your college canteen and food stalls.
- 🛏️ **Order from Your Room**: No more long queues — order and relax.
- 🔔 **Real-Time Updates**: Get notified when your order is prepared, ready, or cancelled.
- 👨‍🍳 **Vendor Dashboard**: Food outlets can update the order status live.
- 🏫 **Campus-Personalised**: Designed specifically for your college environment.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: (Coming soon / or mention what you'll use, like Node.js, Firebase, etc.)
- **Database**: (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL)
- **Notifications**: Web push or email (planned/in progress)


## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Students browse available food items from campus vendors.
2. They place an order directly through the web app.
3. Vendors receive the order and update the status in real time (e.g., "Preparing", "Ready", "Cancelled").
4. Students get notified and pick up their food once ready.

## 🎯 Future Plans

- 💳 Online payment integration
- 📍 Live outlet location tracking
- 🗳️ Food rating and reviews
